      Suggested Enhancements — Add user-flow narrative, MVP clarity,

Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      Nice work on the new set of slides!  I like the clean color scheme and
      the graphics are nice and professional-looking.  One suggestion is to
      use less text under the headings so you can make it bigger and easier
      to read.


Summary:
--------

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after video is posted.


VIDEO EVALUATION
================
This is a good presentation, but there are a few idiosyncrasies to mention.
First off, while A'Kaia is talking Natasha's picture is displayed.  Second,
you are obviously reading from a script, which can get boring to people in
the audience.  It is better to talk from your head knowledge instead ~ it's
more personal and engaging, and makes your presentation less like a sales
presentation.  You want to keep away from making the audience feel like,
"Good evening, is the lady of the house at home?"

Nice work overall on this.  Five of Five points on the deliverable.
