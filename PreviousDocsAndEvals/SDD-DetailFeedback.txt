==========================================

DETAILED CSC AND CSU DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Clearly identifies major CSCs (Authentication, Dashboard, Goal
         Manager, AI Categorization, Gamification, Notification System,
         Admin Dashboard, Reporting Service)
      Each CSC includes CSUs with descriptive names and responsibilities
         (e.g., AuthService, DashboardViewModel, GoalRepository,
         RAGRequestFormatter)
      Provides functional requirement mapping for traceability
   Suggestions:
      Missing design rationale for CSC decomposition
         (why these CSCs were chosen)
      Should include dependency relationships between CSUs
         (e.g., DashboardViewModel depends on ExpenseRepository)
      Add error handling strategies or resilience notes for critical
         CSUs (e.g., AI categorization failures)
      Consider specifying data flow direction and interaction patterns
         between CSUs


DETAILED CLASS DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Each class includes fields and methods with clear naming conventions
      Covers all major functional areas: authentication, dashboard, goals,
         AI categorization, gamification, notifications, admin, reporting
      Good alignment with SwiftUI and Firebase architecture
   Suggestions:
      Add data types consistently for all fields and method parameters
         (some are implied but not explicit)
      Include method signatures with parameter types and return types
         for clarity
      Provide error handling or exception notes for critical methods
         (e.g., signIn, categorize)
      Consider adding relationships between classes
         (e.g., DashboardViewModel interacts with ExpenseRepository)


DETAILED INTERFACE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Interfaces are well-structured with purpose and responsibilities
      Covers all major interactions (Authentication, Dashboard,
         Goal Management, AI Categorization, Gamification, Notifications,
         Admin, Reporting)
      Mentions real-time updates for dashboard and notifications
   Suggestions:
      Include protocol details (e.g., HTTPS, JSON payload format, WebSocket
         for real-time)
      Add security considerations for sensitive data exchange
         (e.g., encryption for AI categorization requests)
      Specify error handling and retry logic for failed interactions
      Consider adding performance constraints
         (e.g., latency for AI categorization)


DETAILED DATA STRUCTURE DESCRIPTIONS:
   Strengths:
      Provides purpose, fields, and operations for each CSC’s data
         structures
      Uses consistent naming conventions and aligns with Firestore schema
      Includes JSON payload formats for AI categorization and notifications
   Suggestions:
      Add data types explicitly for all fields
         (some are implied but not stated)
      Include constraints (e.g., required fields, uniqueness)
      Document validation rules (e.g., category must match predefined set)
      Consider adding example JSON payloads for API interactions


DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   Strengths:
      Includes use case diagram, package diagram, class diagram,
         and state diagram
      Diagrams show multiple perspectives (structural and behavioral)
   Suggestions:
      Ensure diagrams are fully labeled
         (some appear incomplete or lack legends)
      Add sequence diagrams for critical workflows
         (e.g., expense categorization, goal reminder scheduling)
      Include consistency checks between diagrams and textual descriptions
      Provide legends and stereotypes for clarity (e.g., <>, <>)

Overall Completeness Assessment
   Strengths: Excellent coverage of CSC/CSU, class details, interfaces,
               and data structures; strong traceability to requirements.
   Gaps: Missing detailed rationale, explicit data types, error handling,
         and fully annotated diagrams.
   Agile vs Waterfall Fit: Document supports Agile modular design but
      could adapt to waterfall by adding phase-based design rationale
      and review checkpoints.
