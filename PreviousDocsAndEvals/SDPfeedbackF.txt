Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2025
=======================================

INTRODUCTION/DELIVERABLES SECTION:
----------------------------------
   Not applicable


PROJECT RESOURCES SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths:
   Lists hardware resources (MacBook Air, iPhone, Cloud Firestore)
   Lists software resources (Xcode, Firebase, GitHub, Figma, Python,
      Notion)
   Includes task/resource table mapping tasks to developers
      and tools
Suggestions:
   Missing human resource allocation summary
      (e.g., % time per team member)
   No budget or cost estimates for hardware/software licenses
   Should include contingency resources
      (e.g., backup devices or cloud credits)

PROJECT ORGANIZATION SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths:
   Includes a team member table with roles and responsibilities (Project
      Manager, UI/UX Designer, Backend Developer)
   Responsibilities are clearly linked to technical tasks (e.g.,
      Firebase integration, UI design)
Suggestions:
   Missing organizational chart or diagram showing reporting structure.
   No mention of communication plan (how team members coordinate,
      meeting cadence).
   Should clarify decision-making hierarchy and escalation paths.


PROJECT SCHEDULE SECTION:
----------------------------------
Strengths:
   Provides a detailed Gantt-like table with tasks mapped to weeks.
   Identifies critical path (Firebase Setup -> Expense Tracker -> AI
      Categorization -> Testing -> Final Demo)
   Includes milestones (SRS, SDP, Prototype Test, Beta Testing,
      Final Presentation)
Suggestions:
   No dependency diagram or PERT chart to visualize task relationships
   Lacks buffer time for risk mitigation or unexpected delays
   Should include deliverable acceptance checkpoints
   (e.g., sign-off after SRS completion)

   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   5/5 = 100% which is an A-plus on this deliverable

2025-10-18: You still have another shot at this if you want.  Make an SDP
   and a final schedule by the end of the semester and you'll still get
   partial credit for this first submission.

2025-11-22:
Overall Completeness Assessment
   Strong on resources and schedule visualization
   Weak on formal waterfall structure, risk management, quality assurance,
      and review processes
   Agile references make it inconsistent with waterfall expectations but
      that is OK since it's an Agile project
