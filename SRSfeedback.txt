Software Requirements Specification
Initial Development Schedule
CMSI 4072 Spring 2026
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Strengths:
      Contains more than the minimum: models, risks, agile process, etc.
      Organized and easy to follow.
   Suggestions:
      The SRS does not contain a separate performance requirements section,
         which is expected for completeness
      Environment/Execution Requirements are embedded implicitly (iOS,
         Firebase) but not presented as a dedicated section.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Very extensive functional coverage; far above typical SRS completeness.
      All requirements are clear, testable, and framed as user stories with
         acceptance criteria
   Suggestions:
      Some requirements lack explicit system-triggered behavior
         (e.g., what happens on errors, invalid session tokens).
      Some user stories reference dependent components
         (AI module, gamification backend) but no functional requirements
         for their backend interactions.
      Could improve traceability
         (useful for completeness checks per AcqNotes completeness guidelines).

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Provides some quantitative metrics.
      Addresses both speed and reliability.
   Suggestions:
      No load/throughput requirements
         (requests per second, max concurrent users).
      No performance requirements for reporting
         (PDF generation, export timing).
      No requirements for:
         Notification delivery latency
         File upload/processing performance (e.g., CSV import speed)
         Offline mode sync timing
         Database query / load performance
         API performance

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Strengths:
      Identifies platform (iOS), backend (Firebase), and AI system context.
      Sufficiently describes technological constraints.
   Suggestions:
      No dedicated Environment Requirements section
         (e.g., device storage, OS versions, network needs).
      No description of development environment: tools, libraries, languages,
         supported OS/IDE.
      No explicit execution constraints: required bandwidth, minimum iPhone
         model, battery usage expectations.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points
   Component Breakdown               0.8/1
   Functional Requirements           3.7/4
   Performance Requirements          1.8/2
   Environment Requirements          0.9/1
                                     =====
   Subtotal                          7.2/8
   Preliminary Schedule              2.0/2   [Freebee]
   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   9.2/10 = 92% which is an A-minus


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
To improve completeness, do the following:
   Add a complete Environment Requirements section
   Strengthen functional completeness
   A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) helps verify completeness

Nice work on this deliverable ~ You're doing fine!
