=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 1.1 ~ A condensed list (“determining what/how,” building, removing
   bugs, verifying, deploying). Maintenance and wrap-up are missing, and
   design isn’t split into high- vs. low-level phases.  Incomplete relative
   to the expected lifecycle.

Problem 1.2 ~ Clear but not comprehensive for the full lifecycle expected.
   Since this problem is based on the previous one, only one deduction.

Problem 2.4 ~ correct

Problem 2.5 ~ correct

Problem 4.2 ~ Critical path is H, I, D, E, M, Q for a total of 32 days.

Problem 4.4 ~ You built a table, not a Gantt chart as was specified.   Task
   names aren’t mapped to the rows, and weekend/holiday handling isn’t
   demonstrated beyond the holiday table.

Problem 4.6 ~ correct

Problem 4.8 ~  These are not the two textbook mistakes (expected: ignoring
   slippage and adding people to a late task/Brooks’s Law).

Problem 5.1 ~ Close enough.  Not the standard set used in class (typically
   clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, verifiable). “Testable” is
   about the same as “verifiable,” but “necessary/complete” is not the same
   as "prioritized."

Problem 5.3 ~ Each requirement labeled as User, System, Administrator
   (rather than the course’s Business / User / Functional / Nonfunctional /
   Implementation categories).  You used a different scheme than requested,
   so the mapping cannot be credited as correct, though some “User”
   identifications are sensible.

Problem 5.9 ~ correct


nice work!
