=======================================

INTRODUCTION SECTION:
   System objectives section
      Strengths:
         States the architecture follows a modular MVC pattern integrated
            with Firebase, which is appropriate for scalability and
            separation of concerns
         Mentions cross-platform extensibility, showing foresight for
            future development
         Includes a high-level architecture diagram (though details are
            unclear from the text)
      Suggestions:
         The description is brief; should explicitly outline layers
            (Presentation, Business Logic, Data) and their responsibilities
         Include design rationale for choosing MVC and Firebase
            (e.g., why MVC over MVVM for SwiftUI?)
         Add non-functional considerations (performance, security,
            maintainability) tied to architecture
         Ensure the diagram is fully labeled with components, data flows,
            and external services

   Hardware, software, and human interfaces section
      included in above section

ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN SECTION:
   Major softwre components section
      Strengths:
         Provides a clear table listing components, descriptions,
            and related functional requirements
         Covers all major modules: Authentication, Dashboard, Goal Manager,
            AI Engine, Gamification, Notifications, Admin Dashboard, Reporting
         Links components to functional requirements, which is excellent
            for traceability
      Suggestions:
         Missing interfaces between components (e.g., how Dashboard interacts
            with AI Engine)
         Should include responsibility statements and design constraints for
            each component
         Add technology choices for each module (e.g., SwiftUI for Dashboard,
            Firebase Cloud Functions for AI integration)
         Consider specifying data flow direction and dependencies between
            components

   Major software interactions section
      Strengths:
         Lists key interactions (Frontend <-> Firebase, Backend <-> AI Service,
            Notification Service, Admin Panel)
         Mentions security measures (HTTPS, authentication tokens)
         Includes real-time synchronization via Firestore listeners
      Suggestions:
         Interaction descriptions are high-level; should include protocol
            details (e.g., REST vs WebSocket for real-time updates)
         Add error handling strategies for failed AI categorization or
            notification delivery
         Include sequence of operations for critical workflows
            (e.g., expense categorization flow)
         Consider performance constraints (e.g., latency for AI categorization)

Overall Completeness Assessment
   Strengths: Good coverage of components, interactions, and diagrams;
               strong traceability to requirements
   Gaps: Missing detailed rationale, interface specifications,
            error handling, and fully annotated diagrams
   Agile vs Waterfall Fit: Document leans toward Agile-friendly modular
      design, but could easily adapt to waterfall by adding phase-based
      design rationale and review checkpoints
