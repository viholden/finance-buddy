=================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.2 ~ Monolithic is a better answer than two-tier.

Problem 5.4 ~ “Three-tier” is less precise for this assignment but acceptable.

Problem 5.6 ~ ClassyDraw should use a document-centric file-based structure,
   not a database—this is explicitly emphasized in Stephens.

Problem 5.8 ~ Your state machine is a bit off.  There is no way to enter a
   number without a leading sign.

Problem 6.1 ~ correct

Problem 6.2 ~ You are missing a class in the heriarchy.  Line and Text
   can be subclasses of Shape [the way you've defined it] but you need
   a 'Fillable' class at that same level, with the other three classes
   becoming subclasses to 'Fillable'.


nice work!
